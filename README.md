## What Nopyfy can do

First, it generates an Encryption Key, and then encrypts the files with the symmetric AES algorithm method V-2. List of default supported extensions  - </br>

".txt", ".jar", ".exe", ".dat", ".contact" , ".settings", ".doc", ".docx", ".xls", ".xlsx", ".ppt", ".pptx", ".odt", ".jpg", ".png", ".csv", ".py", ".sql", ".mdb", ".sln", ".php", ".asp", ".aspx", ".html", ".htm", ".xml", ".psd" , ".pdf" , ".dll" , ".c" , ".cs", ".mp3" , ".mp4", ".f3d" , ".dwg" , ".cpp" , ".zip" , ".rar" , ".mov" , ".rtf" , ".bmp" , ".mkv" , ".avi" , ".apk" , ".lnk" , ".iso", ".7-zip", ".ace", ".arj", ".bz2", ".cab", ".gzip", ".lzh", ".tar", ".uue", ".xz", ".z", ".001", ".mpeg", ".mp3", ".mpg", ".core", ".crproj" , ".pdb", ".ico" , ".pas" , ".db" ,  ".torrent"

During encryption, Nopyfy creates and writes your message to READ_IT.txt, and saves it in multiple locations to prevent data loss as the READ_IT.txt file contains encrypted victim details with the name 'Victim ID'. When the password sending process started on your server, first it sends the victim data to the PHP server and then it sends the SMTP mail and then it creates a file with the name of the PC and some random words (this will prevent from rewriting the server file) and then it saves the encrypted user details and sends it to the FTP server.
